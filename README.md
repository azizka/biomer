# biomes
Distribute spatially explicit biome definitions and link species occurrences with biomes

# Background

# How to use
`biomes` contains global 10 x10 km rasters of the biome definitions digitized by Fischer et al (2022) plus some additional convenience function to classify records and species into biomes.

## 1. See biome description

# Remaining questions to discuss
 - add consensus biome definition
 - possible to make a selection function based on a trait matrix, to help people select the most suitable biome definition for their purpose
